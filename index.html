						As your sitting president, Ford is experienced in running the

						american assets, sending the Marines and Air Force to <b>recover an
						American freighter that was illegally seized by communists.</b>
						Internally, Ford has prevented the rise of taxes by using the veto
						55 times, saving taxpayers $9.2 billion.

						Twice Ford has stepped up to the plate, staying honest and keeping the country on track

						years as leader of the Republican party prepared him to take over as
						vice president when Agnew resigned. And when former president
						Richard Nixon was exposed, <b> Ford did what was necessary for the
						country to stay on course.</b>

						President Ford vouches to Whip Inflation Now. Already, the inflation

						the bottom of the recession, a new historic high of 87.9 million,
						with unemployment going from <b>8.9% to 7%</b>, and <b>38% more housing starts.</b>
