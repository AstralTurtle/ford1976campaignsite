## PART 1 – <ins>Campaign Brochure</ins>
Please create a trifold campaign brochure or poster for your assigned candidate that promotes the candidate in that election. I have assigned each of you a candidate and (general, not primary) election/year. 

1. The campaign brochure or poster should include some or all of the following: photographs, cartoons, graphics, charts, statistics, slogans, and thoughtful/creative design elements. It should be historically accurate and should be aligned with what the actual candidate was facing at the time. (Know the opponent, the political climate of the time, issues that society was dealing with, etc.)

2. The ad should make the candidate’s political ideology (liberal, conservative, moderate, and so on) clear. You should also address their biography or resume.

3. The ad should be aimed towards a specific group of voters (retrospective voters vs. prospective voters, valence issues vs. position issues voters, and/or specific interest groups). *This is very important to describe and write about in your corresponding essay that analyzes the design of your ad.
